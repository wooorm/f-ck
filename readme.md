## What is this?

This package provides three ways to clean obscene strings: vowels (`c*ss`),
inner letters (`c**s`), and grawlix (`@#$%`).

## When should I use this?

Maybe when you have some cuss words in your tests that you’re tired of looking
at?

## Install

This package is [ESM only][esm].
In Node.js (version 12.20+, 14.14+, or 16.0+), install with [npm][]:

```sh
npm install f-ck
```

In Deno with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```js
import * as fck from 'https://esm.sh/f-ck@2'
```

In browsers with [`esm.sh`][esmsh]:

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as fck from 'https://esm.sh/f-ck@2?bundle'
</script>
```

## Use

```js
import {vowel, inner, grawlix} from 'f-ck'

console.log(vowel('butt')) // => 'b*tt'
console.log(inner('butt')) // => 'b**t'
console.log(grawlix('butt')) // => '@#$%'
console.log(grawlix(7)) // => '@#$%!&?'

console.log(vowel('butt', '-')) // => 'b-tt'
```

## API

This package exports the following identifiers: `vowel`, `inner`, and `grawlix`.
There is no default export.

### `vowel(value[, character])`

Sanitize `value` (`string`) by replacing vowels in `value` with `character`
(`string`, default: `'*'`).

### `inner(value[, character])`

Sanitize `value` (`string`) by replacing all characters except the first and
last in `value` with `character` (`string`, default: `'*'`).

### `grawlix(value[, pattern])`

Sanitize `value` (`string` or `number`) using a [grawlix][] pattern (`string`,
default: `'@#$%!&?'`).
Essentially, repeats `pattern` for `value` (when `number`) or `value.length`
(when `string`) characters.

## Types

This package is fully typed with [TypeScript][].
There are no extra exported types.

## Compatibility

This package is at least compatible with all maintained versions of Node.js.
As of now, that is Node.js 12.20+, 14.14+, and 16.0+.
It also works in Deno and modern browsers.

## Security

This package is safe.
